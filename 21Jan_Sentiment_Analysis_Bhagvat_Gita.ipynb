              "Krishna.\\nTherefore, who doeth work rightful to do,\\nNot seeking gain from work, that man, O Prince!\\nIs Sanyasi and Yogi--both in one\\nAnd he is neither who lights not the flame\\nOf sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task.\\nRegard as true Renouncer him that makes\\nWorship by work, for who renounceth not\\nWorks not as Yogin. So is that well said:\\n\"By works the votary doth rise to faith,\\nAnd saintship is the ceasing from all works;\\nBecause the perfect Yogin acts--but acts\\nUnmoved by passions and unbound by deeds,\\nSetting result aside.\\nLet each man raise\\nThe Self by Soul, not trample down his Self,\\nSince Soul that is Self's friend may grow Self's foe.\\nSoul is Self's friend when Self doth rule o'er Self,\\nBut Self turns enemy if Soul's own self\\nHates Self as not itself.[FN#10]\\nThe sovereign soul\\nOf him who lives self-governed and at peace\\nIs centred in itself, taking alike\\nPleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame.\\nHe is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad\\nWith joy of light and truth; dwelling apart\\nUpon a peak, with senses subjugate\\nWhereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold\\nShow all as one. By this sign is he known\\nBeing of equal grace to comrades, friends,\\nChance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies,\\nAliens and kinsmen; loving all alike,\\nEvil or good.\\nSequestered should he sit,\\nSteadfastly meditating, solitary,\\nHis thoughts controlled, his passions laid away,\\nQuit of belongings. In a fair, still spot\\nHaving his fixed abode,--not too much raised,\\nNor yet too low,--let him abide, his goods\\nA cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass.\\nThere, setting hard his mind upon The One,\\nRestraining heart and senses, silent, calm,\\nLet him accomplish Yoga, and achieve\\nPureness of soul, holding immovable\\nBody and neck and head, his gaze absorbed\\nUpon his nose-end,[FN#11] rapt from all around,\\nTranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent\\nUpon his Brahmacharya vow, devout,\\nMusing on Me, lost in the thought of Me.\\nThat Yojin, so devoted, so controlled,\\nComes to the peace beyond,--My peace, the peace\\nOf high Nirvana!\\nBut for earthly needs\\nReligion is not his who too much fasts\\nOr too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away\\nAn idle mind; nor his who wears to waste\\nHis strength in vigils. Nay, Arjuna! call\\nThat the true piety which most removes\\nEarth-aches and ills, where one is moderate\\nIn eating and in resting, and in sport;\\nMeasured in wish and act; sleeping betimes,\\nWaking betimes for duty.\\nWhen the man,\\nSo living, centres on his soul the thought\\nStraitly restrained--untouched internally\\nBy stress of sense--then is he Yukta. See!\\nSteadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind;\\nSuch is the likeness of the Yogi's mind\\nShut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven.\\nWhen mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont;\\nWhen Self contemplates self, and in itself\\nHath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy\\nBeyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul--\\nOnly to soul! and, knowing, wavers not,\\nTrue to the farther Truth; when, holding this,\\nIt deems no other treasure comparable,\\nBut, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook\\nBy any gravest grief, call that state \"peace,\"\\nThat happy severance Yoga; call that man\\nThe perfect Yogin!\\nSteadfastly the will\\nMust toil thereto, till efforts end in ease,\\nAnd thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off\\nAll longings bred by dreams of fame and gain,\\nShutting the doorways of the senses close\\nWith watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes\\nTo gift of peace assured and heart assuaged,\\nWhen the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods\\nCumberless. But, as often as the heart\\nBreaks--wild and wavering--from control, so oft\\nLet him re-curb it, let him rein it back\\nTo the soul's governance; for perfect bliss\\nGrows only in the bosom tranquillised,\\nThe spirit passionless, purged from offence,\\nVowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows\\nHis soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin,\\nPasses unhindered to the endless bliss\\nOf unity with Brahma. He so vowed,\\nSo blended, sees the Life-Soul resident\\nIn all things living, and all living things\\nIn that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus\\nDiscerneth Me in all, and all in Me,\\nI never let him go; nor looseneth he\\nHold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may,\\nWhate'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives,\\nBecause he knows and worships Me, Who dwell\\nIn all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all.\\nArjuna! if a man sees everywhere--\\nTaught by his own similitude--one Life,\\nOne Essence in the Evil and the Good,\\nHold him a Yogi, yea! well-perfected!\\nArjuna.\\nSlayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog,\\nThis Peace, derived from equanimity,\\nMade known by thee--I see no fixity\\nTherein, no rest, because the heart of men\\nIs unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous,\\nWilful and strong. It were all one, I think,\\nTo hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart.\\nKrishna.\\nHero long-armed! beyond denial, hard\\nMan's heart is to restrain, and wavering;\\nYet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince!\\nBy wont of self-command. This Yog, I say,\\nCometh not lightly to th' ungoverned ones;\\nBut he who will be master of himself\\nShall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto.\\nArjuna.\\nAnd what road goeth he who, having faith,\\nFails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back\\nFrom holiness, missing the perfect rule?\\nIs he not lost, straying from Brahma's light,\\nLike the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven\\nWhen lightning splits it, and it vanisheth?\\nFain would I hear thee answer me herein,\\nSince, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt.\\nKrishna.\\nHe is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No!\\nNor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,\\nBecause no heart that holds one right desire\\nTreadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,\\nDesiring righteousness, cometh at death\\nUnto the Region of the Just; dwells there\\nMeasureless years, and being born anew,\\nBeginneth life again in some fair home\\nAmid the mild and happy. It may chance\\nHe doth descend into a Yogin house\\nOn Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth\\nIs hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!\\nSo hath he back again what heights of heart\\nHe did achieve, and so he strives anew\\nTo perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!\\nFor by the old desire he is drawn on\\nUnwittingly; and only to desire\\nThe purity of Yog is to pass\\nBeyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.\\nBut, being Yogi, striving strong and long,\\nPurged from transgressions, perfected by births\\nFollowing on births, he plants his feet at last\\nUpon the farther path. Such as one ranks\\nAbove ascetics, higher than the wise,\\nBeyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou\\nYogi Arjuna! And of such believe,\\nTruest and best is he who worships Me\\nWith inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!\\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER VI.

This is My glory, unveiled to mortal sight!Sanjaya.\\nThen, O King! the God, so saying,Stood, to Pritha's Son displaying\\nAll the splendour, wonder, dread Of His vast Almighty-head.\\nOut of countless eyes beholding,Out of countless mouths commanding,\\nCountless mystic forms enfolding\\nIn one Form: supremely standing\\nCountless radiant glories wearing,Countless heavenly weapons bearing,\\nCrowned with garlands of star-clusters,Robed in garb of woven lustres,\\nBreathing from His perfect Presence\\nBreaths of every subtle essence\\nOf all heavenly odours; shedding\\nBlinding brilliance; overspreading--\\nBoundless, beautiful--all spaces\\nWith His all-regarding faces;So He showed! If there should rise\\nSuddenly within the skies\\nSunburst of a thousand suns\\nFlooding earth with beams undeemed-of,Then might be that Holy One's\\nMajesty and radiance dreamed of!So did Pandu's Son behold\\nAll this universe enfold\\nAll its huge diversity\\nInto one vast shape, and be\\nVisible, and viewed, and blended\\nIn one Body--subtle, splendid,Nameless--th' All-comprehending\\nGod of Gods, the Never-Ending\\nDeity!\\nBut, sore amazed,\\nThrilled, o'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed,Arjuna knelt; and bowed his head,\\nAnd clasped his palms; and cried, and said:Arjuna.\\nYea! I have seen! I see!Lord! all is wrapped in Thee!The gods are in Thy glorious frame! the creatures\\nOf earth, and heaven, and hell\\nIn Thy Divine form dwell,And in Thy countenance shine all the features\\nOf Brahma, sitting lone\\nUpon His lotus-throne;Of saints and sages, and the serpent races\\nAnanta, Vasuki;Yea! mightiest Lord!

O Head!My strength of soul is fled,\\nGone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire!\\nWhen I behold Thee so,With awful brows a-glow,\\nWith burning glance, and lips lighted by fire\\nFierce as those flames which shall\\nConsume, at close of all,Earth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven!\\nThee, Lord of Lords! I see,Thee only-only Thee!\\nNow let Thy mercy unto me be given,Thou Refuge of the World!\\nLo! to the cavern hurled\\nOf Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed,\\nI see our noblest ones,Great Dhritarashtra's sons,\\nBhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed!\\nThe Kings and Chiefs drawn in,That gaping gorge within;\\nThe best of both these armies torn and riven!\\nBetween Thy jaws they lie\\nMangled full bloodily,Ground into dust and death! Like streams down-driven\\nWith helpless haste, which go\\nIn headlong furious flow\\nStraight to the gulfing deeps of th' unfilled ocean,So to that flaming cave\\nThose heroes great and brave\\nPour, in unending streams, with helpless motion!\\nLike moths which in the night\\nFlutter towards a light,Drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying,\\nSo to their death still throng,\\nBlind, dazzled, borne along\\nCeaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying!\\nThou, that hast fashioned men,Devourest them again,\\nOne with another, great and small, alike!\\nThe creatures whom Thou mak'st,With flaming jaws Thou tak'st,\\nLapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike\\nFrom end to end of earth,Filling life full, from birth\\nTo death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread!Ah, Vishnu! make me know\\nWhy is Thy visage so?Who art Thou, feasting thus upon Thy dead?\\nWho? awful Deity!\\nI bow myself to Thee,\\nNamostu Te, Devavara!

              "Arjuna.\\nThou whom all mortals praise, Janardana!\\nIf meditation be a nobler thing\\nThan action, wherefore, then, great Kesava!\\nDost thou impel me to this dreadful fight?\\nNow am I by thy doubtful speech disturbed!\\nTell me one thing, and tell me certainly;\\nBy what road shall I find the better end?\\nKrishna.\\nI told thee, blameless Lord! there be two paths\\nShown to this world; two schools of wisdom.\\nFirst\\nThe Sankhya's, which doth save in way of works\\nPrescribed[FN#4] by reason; next, the Yog, which bids\\nAttain by meditation, spiritually:\\nYet these are one! No man shall 'scape from act\\nBy shunning action; nay, and none shall come\\nBy mere renouncements unto perfectness.\\nNay, and no jot of time, at any time,\\nRests any actionless; his nature's law\\nCompels him, even unwilling, into act;\\n[For thought is act in fancy]. He who sits\\nSuppressing all the instruments of flesh,\\nYet in his idle heart thinking on them,\\nPlays the inept and guilty hypocrite:\\nBut he who, with strong body serving mind,\\nGives up his mortal powers to worthy work,\\nNot seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one\\nIs honourable. Do thine allotted task!\\nWork is more excellent than idleness;\\nThe body's life proceeds not, lacking work.\\nThere is a task of holiness to do,\\nUnlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not\\nThe faithful soul; such earthly duty do\\nFree from desire, and thou shalt well perform\\nThy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati--\\nIn the beginning, when all men were made,\\nAnd, with mankind, the sacrifice-- \"Do this!\\nWork! sacrifice! Increase and multiply\\nWith sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,\\nYour 'Cow of Plenty,' giving back her milk\\nOf all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;\\nThe gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave\\nThe gods will grant to Labour, when it pays\\nTithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats\\nFruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven\\nNo gift of toil, that thief steals from his world.\"\\nWho eat of food after their sacrifice\\nAre quit of fault, but they that spread a feast\\nAll for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.\\nBy food the living live; food comes of rain,\\nAnd rain comes by the pious sacrifice,\\nAnd sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;\\nThus action is of Brahma, who is One,\\nThe Only, All-pervading; at all times\\nPresent in sacrifice. He that abstains\\nTo help the rolling wheels of this great world,\\nGlutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,\\nShameful and vain. Existing for himself,\\nSelf-concentrated, serving self alone,\\nNo part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,\\nNought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope\\nOf help for all the living things of earth\\nDepends from him.[FN#5] Therefore, thy task prescribed\\nWith spirit unattached gladly perform,\\nSince in performance of plain duty man\\nMounts to his highest bliss. By works alone\\nJanak and ancient saints reached blessedness!\\nMoreover, for the upholding of thy kind,\\nAction thou should'st embrace. What the wise choose\\nThe unwise people take; what best men do\\nThe multitude will follow. Look on me,\\nThou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds\\nI am not bound to any toil, no height\\nAwaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,\\nYet I act here! and, if I acted not--\\nEarnest and watchful--those that look to me\\nFor guidance, sinking back to sloth again\\nBecause I slumbered, would decline from good,\\nAnd I should break earth's order and commit\\nHer offspring unto ruin, Bharata!\\nEven as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,\\nSo let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set\\nTo bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;\\nNot sowing in those simple, busy hearts\\nSeed of despair. Yea! let each play his part\\nIn all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.\\nAll things are everywhere by Nature wrought\\nIn interaction of the qualities.\\nThe fool, cheated by self, thinks, \"This I did\"\\nAnd \"That I wrought; \"but--ah, thou strong-armed Prince!--\\nA better-lessoned mind, knowing the play\\nOf visible things within the world of sense,\\nAnd how the qualities must qualify,\\nStandeth aloof even from his acts. Th' untaught\\nLive mixed with them, knowing not Nature's way,\\nOf highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.\\nThose make thou not to stumble, having the light;\\nBut all thy dues discharging, for My sake,\\nWith meditation centred inwardly,\\nSeeking no profit, satisfied, serene,\\nHeedless of issue--fight! They who shall keep\\nMy ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,\\nHave quittance from all issue of their acts;\\nBut those who disregard My ordinance,\\nThinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,\\nConfused and foolish. 'Sooth, the instructed one\\nDoth of his kind, following what fits him most:\\nAnd lower creatures of their kind; in vain\\nContending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be\\nThe objects of the sense will stir the sense\\nTo like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man\\nYields not to these, knowing them enemies.\\nFinally, this is better, that one do\\nHis own task as he may, even though he fail,\\nThan take tasks not his own, though they seem good.\\nTo die performing duty is no ill;\\nBut who seeks other roads shall wander still.\\nArjuna.\\nYet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man\\nGo to his ill, unwilling; as if one\\nPushed him that evil path?\\nKrishna.\\nKama it is!\\nPassion it is! born of the Darknesses,\\nWhich pusheth him. Mighty of appetite,\\nSinful, and strong is this!--man's enemy!\\nAs smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust\\nMars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds\\nThe babe unborn, so is the world of things\\nFoiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh.\\nThe wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe\\nIt is of wisdom, wearing countless forms,\\nFair but deceitful, subtle as a flame.\\nSense, mind, and reason--these, O Kunti's Son!\\nAre booty for it; in its play with these\\nIt maddens man, beguiling, blinding him.\\nTherefore, thou noblest child of Bharata!\\nGovern thy heart! Constrain th' entangled sense!\\nResist the false, soft sinfulness which saps\\nKnowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong,\\nBut what discerns it stronger, and the mind\\nStrongest; and high o'er all the ruling Soul.\\nWherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme,\\nPut forth full force of Soul in thy own soul!\\nFight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay\\nWhat haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray!\\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER III.

If they be\\nGuilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;\\nTheir sins will light on us, if we shall slay\\nThose sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;\\nWhat peace could come of that, O Madhava?\\nFor if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,\\nThese cannot see, or will not see, the sin\\nOf kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain,\\nHow should not we, who see, shun such a crime--\\nWe who perceive the guilt and feel the shame--\\nO thou Delight of Men, Janardana?\\nBy overthrow of houses perisheth\\nTheir sweet continuous household piety,\\nAnd-rites neglected, piety extinct--\\nEnters impiety upon that home;\\nIts women grow unwomaned, whence there spring\\nMad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,\\nSending a Hell-ward road that family,\\nAnd whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.\\nNay, and the souls of honoured ancestors\\nFall from their place of peace, being bereft\\nOf funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.[FN#1]\\nSo teach our holy hymns.

              "Krishna.\\nThis deathless Yoga, this deep union,\\nI taught Vivaswata,[FN#6] the Lord of Light;\\nVivaswata to Manu gave it; he\\nTo Ikshwaku; so passed it down the line\\nOf all my royal Rishis. Then, with years,\\nThe truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince!\\nNow once again to thee it is declared--\\nThis ancient lore, this mystery supreme--\\nSeeing I find thee votary and friend.\\nArjuna.\\nThy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days,\\nAnd bright Vivaswata's preceded time!\\nHow shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest,\\n\"From the beginning it was I who taught?\"\\nKrishna.\\nManifold the renewals of my birth\\nHave been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too!\\nBut mine I know, and thine thou knowest not,\\nO Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be\\nUnborn, undying, indestructible,\\nThe Lord of all things living; not the less--\\nBy Maya, by my magic which I stamp\\nOn floating Nature-forms, the primal vast--\\nI come, and go, and come. When Righteousness\\nDeclines, O Bharata! when Wickedness\\nIs strong, I rise, from age to age, and take\\nVisible shape, and move a man with men,\\nSuccouring the good, thrusting the evil back,\\nAnd setting Virtue on her seat again.\\nWho knows the truth touching my births on earth\\nAnd my divine work, when he quits the flesh\\nPuts on its load no more, falls no more down\\nTo earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!\\nMany there be who come! from fear set free,\\nFrom anger, from desire; keeping their hearts\\nFixed upon me--my Faithful--purified\\nBy sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these\\nMix with my being. Whoso worship me,\\nThem I exalt; but all men everywhere\\nShall fall into my path; albeit, those souls\\nWhich seek reward for works, make sacrifice\\nNow, to the lower gods. I say to thee\\nHere have they their reward. But I am He\\nMade the Four Castes, and portioned them a place\\nAfter their qualities and gifts. Yea, I\\nCreated, the Reposeful; I that live\\nImmortally, made all those mortal births:\\nFor works soil not my essence, being works\\nWrought uninvolved.[FN#7] Who knows me acting thus\\nUnchained by action, action binds not him;\\nAnd, so perceiving, all those saints of old\\nWorked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou\\nAs, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.\\nThou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before\\nBy singers and by sages, \"What is act,\\nAnd what inaction? \"I will teach thee this,\\nAnd, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save\\nNeeds must one rightly meditate those three--\\nDoing,--not doing,--and undoing. Here\\nThorny and dark the path is! He who sees\\nHow action may be rest, rest action--he\\nIs wisest 'mid his kind; he hath the truth!\\nHe doeth well, acting or resting. Freed\\nIn all his works from prickings of desire,\\nBurned clean in act by the white fire of truth,\\nThe wise call that man wise; and such an one,\\nRenouncing fruit of deeds, always content.\\nAlways self-satisfying, if he works,\\nDoth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,\\nWhich--quit of fear and hope--subduing self--\\nRejecting outward impulse--yielding up\\nTo body's need nothing save body, dwells\\nSinless amid all sin, with equal calm\\nTaking what may befall, by grief unmoved,\\nUnmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same\\nIn good and evil fortunes; nowise bound\\nBy bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,\\nWhose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,\\nWhose heart is set on truth--of such an one\\nWhat work he does is work of sacrifice,\\nWhich passeth purely into ash and smoke\\nConsumed upon the altar! All's then God!\\nThe sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain\\nAre Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats\\nIs Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he\\nWho, in such office, meditates on Brahm.\\nSome votaries there be who serve the gods\\nWith flesh and altar-smoke; but other some\\nWho, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite\\nWith will of worship. Of the which be they\\nWho, in white flame of continence, consume\\nJoys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,\\nForgoing tender speech and sound of song:\\nAnd they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,\\nBurn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss\\nOf youth and love, renouncing happiness:\\nAnd they who lay for offering there their wealth,\\nTheir penance, meditation, piety,\\nTheir steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore\\nPainfully gained with long austerities:\\nAnd they who, making silent sacrifice,\\nDraw in their breath to feed the flame of thought,\\nAnd breathe it forth to waft the heart on high,\\nGoverning the ventage of each entering air\\nLest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul:\\nAnd they who, day by day denying needs,\\nLay life itself upon the altar-flame,\\nBurning the body wan. Lo! all these keep\\nThe rite of offering, as if they slew\\nVictims; and all thereby efface much sin.\\nYea! and who feed on the immortal food\\nLeft of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass,\\nTo The Unending. But for him that makes\\nNo sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot\\nEven in the present world. How should he share\\nAnother, O thou Glory of thy Line?\\nIn sight of Brahma all these offerings\\nAre spread and are accepted! Comprehend\\nThat all proceed by act; for knowing this,\\nThou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice\\nWhich Knowledge pays is better than great gifts\\nOffered by wealth, since gifts' worth--O my Prince!\\nLies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:\\nAnd these are gained by reverence, by strong search,\\nBy humble heed of those who see the Truth\\nAnd teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more\\nWill ache with error, for the Truth shall show\\nAll things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.\\nMoreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst\\nOf all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth\\nShould bear thee safe and dry across the sea\\nOf thy transgressions. As the kindled flame\\nFeeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash,\\nSo unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought\\nThe flame of Knowledge wastes works' dross away!\\nThere is no purifier like thereto\\nIn all this world, and he who seeketh it\\nShall find it--being grown perfect--in himself.\\nBelieving, he receives it when the soul\\nMasters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes--\\nPossessing knowledge--to the higher peace,\\nThe uttermost repose. But those untaught,\\nAnd those without full faith, and those who fear\\nAre shent; no peace is here or other where,\\nNo hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts.\\nHe that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt,\\nDisparting self from service, soul from works,\\nEnlightened and emancipate, my Prince!\\nWorks fetter him no more! Cut then atwain\\nWith sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata!\\nThis doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond\\nBorn of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise!\\nGive thyself to the field with me! Arise!\\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER IV.

Who sees these twain as one\\nSees with clear eyes! Yet such abstraction, Chief!\\nIs hard to win without much holiness.\\nWhoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled,\\nPure-hearted, lord of senses and of self,\\nLost in the common life of all which lives--\\nA \"Yogayukt\"--he is a Saint who wends\\nStraightway to Brahm.

Him meditating still,\\nHim seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him,\\nThe souls illuminated take that road\\nWhich hath no turning back--their sins flung off\\nBy strength of faith.

Be not over-glad\\nAttaining joy, and be not over-sad\\nEncountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still\\nConstant let each abide!

Whoso, Kunti's Son!\\nMothers each mortal form, Brahma conceives,\\nAnd I am He that fathers, sending seed!\\nSattwan, Rajas, and Tamas, so are named\\nThe qualities of Nature, \"Soothfastness,\"\\n\"Passion,\" and \"Ignorance.\" These three bind down\\nThe changeless Spirit in the changeful flesh.\\nWhereof sweet \"Soothfastness,\" by purity\\nLiving unsullied and enlightened, binds\\nThe sinless Soul to happiness and truth;\\nAnd Passion, being kin to appetite,\\nAnd breeding impulse and propensity,\\nBinds the embodied Soul, O Kunti's Son!\\nBy tie of works. But Ignorance, begot\\nOf Darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down\\nTheir souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness.\\nYea, Prince of India! Soothfastness binds souls\\nIn pleasant wise to flesh; and Passion binds\\nBy toilsome strain; but Ignorance, which blots\\nThe beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth.\\nPassion and Ignorance, once overcome,\\nLeave Soothfastness, O Bharata!

              "Arjuna.\\nFain would I better know, Thou Glorious One!The very truth--Heart's Lord!--of Sannyas,\\nAbstention; and enunciation, Lord!Tyaga; and what separates these twain!\\nKrishna.The poets rightly teach that Sannyas\\nIs the foregoing of all acts which spring\\nOut of desire; and their wisest say\\nTyaga is renouncing fruit of acts.\\nThere be among the saints some who have held\\nAll action sinful, and to be renounced;And some who answer, \"Nay! the goodly acts--\\nAs worship, penance, alms--must be performed!\"Hear now My sentence, Best of Bharatas!\\n'Tis well set forth, O Chaser of thy Foes!Renunciation is of threefold form,\\nAnd Worship, Penance, Alms, not to be stayed;Nay, to be gladly done; for all those three\\nAre purifying waters for true souls!Yet must be practised even those high works\\nIn yielding up attachment, and all fruit\\nProduced by works. This is My judgment, Prince!\\nThis My insuperable and fixed decree!Abstaining from a work by right prescribed\\nNever is meet! So to abstain doth spring\\nFrom \"Darkness,\" and Delusion teacheth it.Abstaining from a work grievous to flesh,\\nWhen one saith \"'Tis unpleasing!\" this is null!\\nSuch an one acts from \"passion;\" nought of gain\\nWins his Renunciation! But, Arjun!Abstaining from attachment to the work,\\nAbstaining from rewardment in the work,While yet one doeth it full faithfully,\\nSaying, \"Tis right to do!\" that is \"true \" act\\nAnd abstinence! Who doeth duties so,Unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed\\nUnflattered, in his own heart justified,Quit of debates and doubts, his is \"true\" act:\\nFor, being in the body, none may stand\\nWholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains\\nFrom profit of his acts is abstinent.The fruit of labours, in the lives to come,\\nIs threefold for all men,--Desirable,And Undesirable, and mixed of both;\\nBut no fruit is at all where no work was.Hear from me, Long-armed Lord! the makings five\\nWhich go to every act, in Sankhya taught\\nAs necessary. First the force; and then\\nThe agent; next, the various instruments;Fourth, the especial effort; fifth, the God.\\nWhat work soever any mortal dothOf body, mind, or speech, evil or good,\\nBy these five doth he that. Which being thus,Whoso, for lack of knowledge, seeth himself\\nAs the sole actor, knoweth nought at all\\nAnd seeth nought. Therefore, I say, if one--Holding aloof from self--with unstained mind\\nShould slay all yonder host, being bid to slay,He doth not slay; he is not bound thereby!\\nKnowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows,These make the threefold starting-ground of act.\\nThe act, the actor, and the instrument,These make the threefold total of the deed.\\nBut knowledge, agent, act, are differenced\\nBy three dividing qualities. Hear now\\nWhich be the qualities dividing them.\\nThere is \"true\" Knowledge. Learn thou it is this:To see one changeless Life in all the Lives,\\nAnd in the Separate, One Inseparable.There is imperfect Knowledge: that which sees\\nThe separate existences apart,And, being separated, holds them real.There is false Knowledge: that which blindly clings\\nTo one as if 'twere all, seeking no Cause,Deprived of light, narrow, and dull, and \"dark.\"There is \"right\" Action: that which being enjoined--\\nIs wrought without attachment, passionlessly,For duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain.\\nThere is \"vain\" Action: that which men pursue\\nAching to satisfy desires, impelled\\nBy sense of self, with all-absorbing stress:This is of Rajas--passionate and vain.There is \"dark\" Action: when one doth a thing\\nHeedless of issues, heedless of the hurt\\nOr wrong for others, heedless if he harm\\nHis own soul--'tis of Tamas, black and bad!There is the \"rightful\"doer. He who acts\\nFree from self-seeking, humble, resolute,Steadfast, in good or evil hap the same,\\nContent to do aright-he \"truly\" acts.There is th' \"impassioned\" doer. He that works\\nFrom impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold\\nTo overcome, unchastened; slave by turns\\nOf sorrow and of joy: of Rajas he!\\nAnd there be evil doers; loose of heart,Low-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss,\\nDull, slow, despondent--children of the \"dark.\"Hear, too, of Intellect and Steadfastness\\nThe threefold separation, Conqueror-Prince!How these are set apart by Qualities.\\nGood is the Intellect which comprehends\\nThe coming forth and going back of life,What must be done, and what must not be done,What should be feared, and what should not be feared,\\nWhat binds and what emancipates the soul:That is of Sattwan, Prince! of \"soothfastness.\"\\nMarred is the Intellect which, knowing right\\nAnd knowing wrong, and what is well to do\\nAnd what must not be done, yet understands\\nNought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is:This is of Rajas, Prince! and \"passionate!\"\\nEvil is Intellect which, wrapped in gloom,Looks upon wrong as right, and sees all things\\nContrariwise of Truth. O Pritha's Son!That is of Tamas, \"dark\" and desperate!\\nGood is the steadfastness whereby a man\\nMasters his beats of heart, his very breath\\nOf life, the action of his senses; fixed\\nIn never-shaken faith and piety:That is of Sattwan, Prince! \"soothfast\" and fair!\\nStained is the steadfastness whereby a man\\nHolds to his duty, purpose, effort, end,For life's sake, and the love of goods to gain,\\nArjuna! 'tis of Rajas, passion-stamped!Sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool\\nCleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears,His folly and despair. This--Pritha's Son!--\\nIs born of Tamas, \"dark\" and miserable!Hear further, Chief of Bharatas! from Me\\nThe threefold kinds of Pleasure which there be.Good Pleasure is the pleasure that endures,\\nBanishing pain for aye; bitter at first\\nAs poison to the soul, but afterward\\nSweet as the taste of Amrit. Drink of that!It springeth in the Spirit's deep content.\\nAnd painful Pleasure springeth from the bond\\nBetween the senses and the sense-world. Sweet\\nAs Amrit is its first taste, but its last\\nBitter as poison. 'Tis of Rajas, Prince!\\nAnd foul and \"dark\" the Pleasure is which springs\\nFrom sloth and sin and foolishness; at first\\nAnd at the last, and all the way of life\\nThe soul bewildering. 'Tis of Tamas, Prince!For nothing lives on earth, nor 'midst the gods\\nIn utmost heaven, but hath its being bound\\nWith these three Qualities, by Nature framed.The work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,\\nAnd Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes!Is fixed by reason of the Qualities\\nPlanted in each:\\nA Brahman's virtues, Prince!Born of his nature, are serenity,\\nSelf-mastery, religion, purity,Patience, uprightness, learning, and to know\\nThe truth of things which be. A Kshatriya's pride,Born of his nature, lives in valour, fire,\\nConstancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight,And open-handedness and noble mien,\\nAs of a lord of men. A Vaisya's task,Born with his nature, is to till the ground,\\nTend cattle, venture trade. A Sudra's state,Suiting his nature, is to minister.\\nWhoso performeth--diligent, content--\\nThe work allotted him, whate'er it be,Lays hold of perfectness!

To man's frame\\nAs there come infancy and youth and age,\\nSo come there raisings-up and layings-down\\nOf other and of other life-abodes,\\nWhich the wise know, and fear not. This that irks--\\nThy sense-life, thrilling to the elements--\\nBringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,\\n'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!\\nAs the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,\\nThe soul that with a strong and constant calm\\nTakes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,\\nLives in the life undying! That which is\\nCan never cease to be; that which is not\\nWill not exist. To see this truth of both\\nIs theirs who part essence from accident,\\nSubstance from shadow. Indestructible,\\nLearn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;\\nIt cannot anywhere, by any means,\\nBe anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.\\nBut for these fleeting frames which it informs\\nWith spirit deathless, endless, infinite,\\nThey perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!\\nHe who shall say, \"Lo! I have slain a man!\"\\nHe who shall think, \"Lo! I am slain!\" those both\\nKnow naught! Life cannot slay.

Impenetrable,\\nUnentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,\\nImmortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,\\nInvisible, ineffable, by word\\nAnd thought uncompassed, ever all itself,\\nThus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,--\\nKnowing it so,--grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?\\nHow, if thou hearest that the man new-dead\\nIs, like the man new-born, still living man--\\nOne same, existent Spirit--wilt thou weep?\\nThe end of birth is death; the end of death\\nIs birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,\\nChief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls\\nWhich could not otherwise befall? The birth\\nOf living things comes unperceived; the death\\nComes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:\\nWhat is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?\\nWonderful, wistful, to contemplate!\\nDifficult, doubtful, to speak upon!\\nStrange and great for tongue to relate,\\nMystical hearing for every one!\\nNor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,\\nWhen seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!\\nThis Life within all living things, my Prince!\\nHides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,\\nFor that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!\\nBe mindful of thy name, and tremble not!\\nNought better can betide a martial soul\\nThan lawful war; happy the warrior\\nTo whom comes joy of battle--comes, as now,\\nGlorious and fair, unsought; opening for him\\nA gateway unto Heav'n. But, if thou shunn'st\\nThis honourable field--a Kshattriya--\\nIf, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st\\nDuty and task go by--that shall be sin!\\nAnd those to come shall speak thee infamy\\nFrom age to age; but infamy is worse\\nFor men of noble blood to bear than death!\\nThe chiefs upon their battle-chariots\\nWill deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.\\nOf those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn\\nThou must abide, while all thine enemies\\nWill scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock\\nThe valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall\\nMore grievously than this? Either--being killed--\\nThou wilt win Swarga's safety, or--alive\\nAnd victor--thou wilt reign an earthly king.\\nTherefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace\\nThine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet--\\nAs things alike to thee--pleasure or pain,\\nProfit or ruin, victory or defeat:\\nSo minded, gird thee to the fight, for so\\nThou shalt not sin!\\nThus far I speak to thee\\nAs from the \"Sankhya\"--unspiritually--\\nHear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,\\nWhich holding, understanding, thou shalt burst\\nThy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.\\nHere shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,\\nNo loss be feared: faith--yea, a little faith--\\nShall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.\\nHere, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule--\\nOne steadfast rule--while shifting souls have laws\\nMany and hard.

Much these teach,\\nFrom Veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\"\\nBut thou, be free of the \"three qualities,\"\\nFree of the \"pairs of opposites,\"[FN#2] and free\\nFrom that sad righteousness which calculates;\\nSelf-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied![FN#3]\\nLook! like as when a tank pours water forth\\nTo suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw\\nText for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.\\nBut thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward\\nOf doing right in right! Let right deeds be\\nThy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.\\nAnd live in action! Labour! Make thine acts\\nThy piety, casting all self aside,\\nContemning gain and merit; equable\\nIn good or evil: equability\\nIs Yog, is piety!\\nYet, the right act\\nIs less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.\\nSeek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!\\nScorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!\\nThe mind of pure devotion--even here--\\nCasts equally aside good deeds and bad,\\nPassing above them. Unto pure devotion\\nDevote thyself: with perfect meditation\\nComes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise--\\nMore certainly because they seek no gain--\\nForth from the bands of body, step by step,\\nTo highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul\\nHath shaken off those tangled oracles\\nWhich ignorantly guide, then shall it soar\\nTo high neglect of what's denied or said,\\nThis way or that way, in doctrinal writ.\\nTroubled no longer by the priestly lore,\\nSafe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent\\nOn meditation. This is Yog--and Peace!\\nArjuna.\\nWhat is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,\\nConfirmed in holy meditation? How\\nKnow we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he\\nLike other men?\\nKrishna.\\nWhen one, O Pritha's Son!\\nAbandoning desires which shake the mind--\\nFinds in his soul full comfort for his soul,\\nHe hath attained the Yog--that man is such!,In sorrows not dejected, and in joys\\nNot overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress,Of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms\\nOf lofty contemplation;--such an one,\\nIs Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!\\nHe who to none and nowhere overbound,By ties of flesh, takes evil things and good\\nNeither desponding nor exulting, such,Bears wisdom's plainest mark! He who shall draw\\nAs the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe\\nUnder its shield, his five frail senses back\\nUnder the spirit's buckler from the world\\nWhich else assails them, such an one, my Prince!\\nHath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense\\nHold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,\\nThe appetites of him who lives beyond,Depart,--aroused no more. Yet may it chance,\\nO Son of Kunti! that a governed mind,Shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest\\nStrong self-control by the roots. Let him regain\\nHis kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit\\nOn Me intent. That man alone is wise,Who keeps the mastery of himself! If one\\nPonders on objects of the sense, there springs\\nAttraction; from attraction grows desire,Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds\\nRecklessness; then the memory--all betrayed--\\nLets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,Till purpose, mind, and man are all undone.\\nBut, if one deals with objects of the sense\\nNot loving and not hating, making them,Serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord,\\nLo! such a man comes to tranquillity;And out of that tranquillity shall rise\\nThe end and healing of his earthly pains,\\nSince the will governed sets the soul at peace.\\nThe soul of the ungoverned is not his,Nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,\\nHow grows serenity? and, wanting that,Whence shall he hope for happiness?\\nThe mind,That gives itself to follow shows of sense\\nSeeth its helm of wisdom rent away,,And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives\\nTo wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince!\\nWhose senses are not swayed by things of sense--\\nOnly with him who holds his mastery,Shows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom\\nTo unenlightened souls shines wakeful day\\nTo his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day\\nIs known for night, thick night of ignorance,\\nTo his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint!\\nAnd like the ocean, day by day receiving,Floods from all lands, which never overflows\\nIts boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving,Fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;--\\nSo is the perfect one! to his soul's ocean,The world of sense pours streams of witchery;\\nThey leave him as they find, without commotion,\\nTaking their tribute, but remaining sea.Yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh\\nLives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free\\nFrom pride, from passion, from the sin of \"Self,\"\\nToucheth tranquillity! O Pritha's Son!,That is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread\\nWhen that last step is reached!
